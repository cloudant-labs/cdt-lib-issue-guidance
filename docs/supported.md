# Reporting an error with a library or integration

It sounds like there might be a problem with library you are using. To help us
provide the best service consider these points to direct your service request.

**In all cases please include all the information asked for in the GitHub issue
template as it enables us to service your request as efficiently as possible.**

## Are you an IBM Cloudant customer

### YES

Check the GitHub repository of the library you are using for existing similar
issues. If there is not one then create a new GitHub issue including the
information in the template and a simple example to reproduce the problem.

Contact IBM Cloudant support if:
* The issue is only reproducible using your account or example data that cannot
be anonymized or made public.
* You need to provide any confidential or non-public information.
* You do not have a GitHub account and you do not want to create one.

The best way to do this is via your service dashboard as this
will include your account information in the request and help support expedite
assisting you.

Please note that _Gold_ support is limited to the service and does not apply to
the libraries and also that telephone support is not available.

**Do not forget to include the information requested in the GitHub issue template
even if you open an issue via IBM Cloudant support.**

### NO

Open a GitHub issue in the repository of the library you are using
including the information in the template and a simple example to reproduce the
problem.

We will try to help, but Cloudant use cases are our priority.

Note that whilst the Cloudant libraries are usually compatible with Apache
CouchDB and other CouchDB API compatible database servers please keep in mind
that this is not always the case.
