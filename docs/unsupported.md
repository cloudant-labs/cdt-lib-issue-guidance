# Reporting an error with a library or integration

It seems like there might be a problem with library you are using, but it is
either unsupported or not owned by Cloudant.

## Open an issue

Open an issue in the GitHub repository or appropriate issue tracker for the
library you are using following any guidance or issue templates available.

We are unable to provide any assistance for libraries that are not owned by IBM
Cloudant. If the library is owned by IBM Cloudant we will attempt to assist as
soon as we are able, but please keep in mind that our supported libraries take
precedence and it may be some time before we are able to respond.
