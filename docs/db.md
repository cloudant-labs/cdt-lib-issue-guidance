# Reporting an error with a library or integration

It seems like the problem you are seeing is more likely with the database than
the integration library.

## Which database are you using?

### IBM Cloudant

Contact support. The best way to do this is via your service dashboard as this
will include your account information in the request and help support expedite
assisting you.

### Apache CouchDB

Consult the `Guidance` section on the [Apache CouchDB](couchdb.apache.org) site
for links to getting help including IRC/Slack, mailing lists, and GitHub issues.
