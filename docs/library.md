# Reporting an error with a library or integration

## Are you using a supported library?

### [YES](./supported.md)
### [NO](./unsupported.md)

## How can I tell?

* Identify supported libraries by consulting the [documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/index.html#client-libraries).
* Recall that only the latest released version of each library is supported:
    > A supported library is one where you can contact Cloudant NoSQL DB if you encounter a specific, reproducible problem in the latest version of the library.

    If you are using an older version of a library, try to reproduce the issue on the latest version.
